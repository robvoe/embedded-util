# embedded-util
Provides utility functionality that mainly focuses on embedded architectures, especially STM32. Nevertheless, many of the provided modules may be used on architectures different from STM32.

Programming languages are C and C++, using GCC and G++.

To make all modules work properly, the base folder must be added to "Include paths" (see regarding GCC/G++ compiler settings).
